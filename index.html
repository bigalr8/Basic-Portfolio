                        Moved From Bridgeport Ct to Phila as a baby. Spent summers in Va. Job relocations took me to
                         Mont. Co. MD., then back to Phila. Then again to Manhattan, commuting there daily from 
                         Cheltenham for 10 years. Worked from home after adopting two babies. Stay-at-home dad for
                          past 2 years. Plead guilty to enjoying a CAO Amazon when opportunity arises. On Google 
                          daily looking up something. Until recently was also on Udacity daily taking courses.
